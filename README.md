Image Classification using CNN on CIFAR-10 Dataset
Overview
This project demonstrates an image classification task using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes. The model is designed to classify images into one of these classes, which include categories such as airplanes, cars, birds, cats, dogs, and more.

The project focuses on building a CNN model that extracts features from the images and performs classification with high accuracy.

Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of the following:

60,000 images in total.
50,000 training images.
10,000 test images.
Image resolution: 32x32 pixels with 3 color channels (RGB).
10 classes:
Airplane
Automobile
Bird
Cat
Deer
Dog
Frog
Horse
Ship
Truck
Each image in the CIFAR-10 dataset is labeled with one of these categories. The dataset is split into training and test sets.

Libraries and Dependencies
This project requires the following Python libraries:

TensorFlow (for deep learning model building and training)
NumPy (for numerical computations)
Matplotlib (for data visualization)
To install these dependencies, you can run the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
Model Architecture
The model used in this project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which consists of the following components:

Convolutional Layers: These layers extract features from the images by applying filters (kernels) and performing convolutions. They are responsible for detecting patterns such as edges, textures, and shapes in the images.

Max Pooling Layers: These layers help reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, thus reducing the number of parameters and computations in the network while retaining the important features.

Flatten Layer: After the convolution and pooling layers, the output is a 2D feature map, which is then flattened into a 1D vector to feed into the fully connected (dense) layers.

Fully Connected Layers: These layers are responsible for classification. The fully connected layers connect every neuron to all neurons in the previous layer, enabling the network to make predictions.

Dropout Layer: A regularization technique used to prevent overfitting by randomly setting a fraction of the input units to zero during training.

Softmax Activation: This activation function is used in the output layer to convert the model's raw predictions into probabilities, which sum to 1.

Model Training and Evaluation
Training: The model is trained on the CIFAR-10 training set for 10 epochs. During training, the model learns to recognize patterns in the images and adjusts its weights to minimize the loss function.

Loss Function: Sparse Categorical Crossentropy is used as the loss function, as the task involves multi-class classification with integer labels.

Optimizer: Adam optimizer is used to minimize the loss function. It adapts the learning rate during training for better performance.

Metrics: The accuracy of the model is tracked during training and evaluation to measure how well the model is performing.

Training Results and Visualization
After training the model, the performance is evaluated on the CIFAR-10 test set. The accuracy achieved on the test set indicates how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data.

Additionally, the training and validation accuracy are visualized over epochs to monitor the model's learning process. This helps in identifying any signs of overfitting or underfitting.

Conclusion
In this project, we built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 distinct classes. The model achieved a reasonable level of accuracy after training, and further improvements can be made by experimenting with:

Advanced regularization techniques (e.g., data augmentation, batch normalization).
Hyperparameter tuning (e.g., adjusting the number of layers, filters, and learning rates).
More complex architectures like ResNet or VGG for potentially better performance.
Future Work
Hyperparameter Tuning: Experimenting with hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance.
Model Enhancement: Implementing more advanced models, such as pre-trained networks like VGG16, ResNet, or Inception, and fine-tuning them on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
Data Augmentation: Applying data augmentation techniques to artificially increase the size of the training set and help the model generalize better.
